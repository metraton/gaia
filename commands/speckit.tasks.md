description: Generate an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for the feature based on available design artifacts.

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

**IMPORTANT**: This command now requires TWO arguments:
1. `<speckit-root>`: Path to spec-kit root directory (e.g., `specs`)
2. `<feature-name>`: Feature name (e.g., `004-project-guidance-deployment`)

**Example usage**:
```
/speckit.tasks specs 004-project-guidance-deployment
```

1. Extract `<speckit-root>` and `<feature-name>` from $ARGUMENTS. If not provided, ERROR and show usage example.
2. Derive paths manually (no check-prerequisites.sh needed):
   ```
   SPECKIT_ROOT = <speckit-root> (resolve to absolute if relative)
   FEATURE_DIR = $SPECKIT_ROOT/specs/<feature-name>
   IMPL_PLAN = $FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
   DATA_MODEL = $FEATURE_DIR/data-model.md
   CONTRACTS_DIR = $FEATURE_DIR/contracts/
   RESEARCH = $FEATURE_DIR/research.md
   QUICKSTART = $FEATURE_DIR/quickstart.md
   TASKS = $FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md
   ```
3. Check which design documents are available (use file existence checks):
2. Load and analyze available design documents:
   - Always read plan.md for tech stack and libraries
   - IF EXISTS: Read data-model.md for entities
   - IF EXISTS: Read contracts/ for API endpoints
   - IF EXISTS: Read research.md for technical decisions
   - IF EXISTS: Read quickstart.md for test scenarios

   Note: Not all projects have all documents. For example:
   - CLI tools might not have contracts/
   - Simple libraries might not need data-model.md
   - Generate tasks based on what's available

3. Generate tasks following the template:
   - Use `.claude/speckit/templates/tasks-template.md` as the base
   - Replace example tasks with actual tasks based on:
     * **Setup tasks**: Project init, dependencies, linting
     * **Test tasks [P]**: One per contract, one per integration scenario
     * **Core tasks**: One per entity, service, CLI command, endpoint
     * **Integration tasks**: DB connections, middleware, logging
     * **Polish tasks [P]**: Unit tests, performance, docs

4. Task generation rules:
   - Each contract file → contract test task marked [P]
   - Each entity in data-model → model creation task marked [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task (not parallel if shared files)
   - Each user story → integration test marked [P]
   - Different files = can be parallel [P]
   - Same file = sequential (no [P])

5. Order tasks by dependencies:
   - Setup before everything
   - Tests before implementation (TDD)
   - Models before services
   - Services before endpoints
   - Core before integration
   - Everything before polish

6. Include parallel execution examples:
   - Group [P] tasks that can run together
   - Show actual Task agent commands

7. Create FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md with enriched metadata:
   - Correct feature name from implementation plan
   - Numbered tasks (T001, T002, etc.)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependency notes
   - Parallel execution guidance
   - **INLINE metadata for EVERY task** (generated automatically, not post-processed)

8. **Automatic Task Enrichment (MANDATORY)**:
   For EACH task you generate, automatically add metadata comments IMMEDIATELY after the task line:

   **Task Format**:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] T001 Create GKE cluster configuration
     <!-- 🤖 Agent: terraform-architect | 👁️ T0 | ⚡ 0.85 -->
     <!-- 🏷️ Tags: #terraform #infrastructure #gke -->
     <!-- 🎯 skill: terraform_infrastructure (8.0) -->
   ```

   **Surface Routing Rules** (analyze task description):

   | Signals in Task | Primary Surface | Primary Agent | Tier |
   |-----------------|-----------------|---------------|------|
   | terraform, terragrunt, .tf, infrastructure, vpc, gke, cloud-sql | terraform_iac | terraform-architect | T0 (read), T2 (plan), T3 (apply) |
   | kubectl, helm, flux, kubernetes, k8s, deployment, service, ingress | gitops_desired_state | gitops-operator | T0 (read), T2 (dry-run), T3 (push) |
   | gcloud, GCP, cloud logging, IAM, service account, live cluster, runtime drift | live_runtime | cloud-troubleshooter | T0 (diagnostics) |
   | docker, npm, build, test, CI, pipeline, Dockerfile | app_ci_tooling | developer | T0-T1 |

   If multiple rows match, treat the task as multi-surface in your reasoning. Keep one primary agent in the inline metadata, but note the adjacent surface(s) in the reasoning comment.

   **Security Tier Detection**:
   - T0: describe, get, show, list, logs, read operations
   - T1: validate, lint, template, format operations
   - T2: plan, dry-run, diff operations
   - T3: apply, push, create, delete, deploy operations (⚠️ HIGH RISK)

   **Tag Generation** (add ALL matching):
   - Tech: #terraform #kubernetes #helm #docker #gcp #aws
   - Domain: #database #security #networking #api #monitoring
   - Work: #setup #test #deploy #config #docs #debug

   **Priority Signal**:
   - ❓ Low complexity (setup, config, docs)
   - ⚡ Medium complexity (implementation, integration)
   - 🔥 High impact (security, database, production)

   **High-Risk Warning** (for T2/T3 tasks):
   ```markdown
   - [ ] T042 Apply Terraform changes to production VPC
     <!-- 🤖 Agent: terraform-architect | 🚫 T3 | 🔥 0.95 -->
     <!-- 🏷️ Tags: #terraform #infrastructure #networking #production -->
     <!-- ⚠️ HIGH RISK: Analyze before execution -->
     <!-- 💡 Suggested: /speckit.analyze-task T042 -->
     <!-- 🎯 skill: terraform_infrastructure (12.0) -->
   ```

   **CRITICAL**: Generate ALL tasks with metadata inline. NO post-processing step required.

9. **Automatic Cross-Artifact Validation (Integrated)**:
   After generating tasks.md, IMMEDIATELY perform consistency analysis:

   a) **Load artifacts for validation**:
      - spec.md: Functional/Non-functional requirements, User Stories, Edge Cases
      - plan.md: Architecture, Data Model, Technical constraints
      - tasks.md: All generated tasks with metadata
      - `<speckit-root>/governance.md`: Architectural principles and standards

   b) **Detection passes** (automated):
      - **Duplication**: Flag near-duplicate requirements or tasks
      - **Ambiguity**: Detect vague adjectives ("fast", "robust") without measurable criteria, unresolved TODOs/placeholders
      - **Underspecification**: Requirements missing acceptance criteria, tasks referencing undefined components
      - **Governance alignment**: Check against principles (GitOps, Code-First Protocol, Security Tiers, etc.)
      - **Coverage gaps**: Requirements with zero tasks, tasks with no mapped requirement, missing non-functional coverage
      - **Inconsistency**: Terminology drift, data entities mismatch, task ordering contradictions

   c) **Severity assignment**:
      - CRITICAL: Violates governance MUST principle, requirement with zero coverage
      - HIGH: Duplicate/conflicting requirements, ambiguous security/performance
      - MEDIUM: Terminology drift, missing non-functional coverage
      - LOW: Style/wording improvements

   d) **Validation report** (inline output):
      ```markdown
      ### Validation Report

      **Metrics**:
      - Total Requirements: X
      - Total Tasks: Y
      - Coverage: Z% (requirements with ≥1 task)
      - Issues: A critical, B high, C medium, D low

      **Issues Found**:
      | ID | Severity | Category | Location | Summary | Recommendation |
      |----|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
      | A1 | CRITICAL | Coverage | spec.md:L45 | "Performance monitoring" has zero tasks | Add task for metrics/logging setup |
      | A2 | HIGH | Ambiguity | spec.md:L89 | "Fast response time" lacks metric | Clarify: <200ms p95 latency? |

      **Next Actions**:
      - If CRITICAL issues: Resolve before proceeding to execution
      - If only MEDIUM/LOW: Proceed with caution, address during implementation
      ```

   e) **Automatic remediation** (if no CRITICAL issues):
      - For LOW/MEDIUM issues: Add notes to tasks.md Dependencies section
      - For ambiguities: Flag for clarification during execution
      - For coverage gaps: Generate missing tasks inline

   f) **Gate decision**:
      - If CRITICAL issues found: Pause and require user approval to proceed
      - If only HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW: Report and continue
      - If zero issues: Report success and proceed

   **CRITICAL**: Validation runs automatically. NO separate /analyze-plan command needed.

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable -- each task must be self-contained with enough inline context (context slice, file paths, exit criteria) that an agent can complete it without loading multiple planning files. The orchestrator will route each task to the appropriate agent for execution.
